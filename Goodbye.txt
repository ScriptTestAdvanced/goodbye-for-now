Hello everyone, White Cat here. I didn't think i'd be doing this, but it's time to say goodbye. Ever since Toasty (Sivy) nuked my server I felt like giving up, and I didn', I still procceded into making a new STA server, but I knew that I was never going to get all my members back.

And today is finally the day I say goodbye for now. I didn't want to do this, but I had too. I feel like exploiting is over now, Cereal left, Rinn left, and now I leave. But temporairly!

I will still be active on discord sometimes, but for STA, it's goodbye for now.

Now if this becomes permanent, I will NOT come back. But I need some time off and will see.


Goodbye for now,

White Cat out.
