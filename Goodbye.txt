Hello everyone, White Cat here. And this is the time to say, goodbye forever. I am deleting discord (not my account) forever and when I do get back online on Discord, that will be a while. This shit is to hard for me to handle and I just can't take it.

Me and Sivy are no longer friends because Sivy is a fake retarded loser, he cares about me my ass. Anyways, I am sorry to everyone who supported me, I love y'all so much and without Rune, Nano, Starlight and Black Cat. I wouldn't have started STA. I know it was nuked and will never get my members back, but the reason I quit is because this shit is too hard to handle, all because of a damn joke this shit happens.

So I want to say my last goodbyes, and will come back on Discord in the future, maybe 2026 or something, but this year will be 0% and next year might be chance, but if I forget about Discord I will never comeback.

Thanks for all the support and love, and goodbye..

White Cat.
